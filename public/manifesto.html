      <h1>Manifesto</h1>

      <p>OB1 stands for “Obekväma arbetstider 1” in Swedish — or “Inconvenient Working Hours – Category 1” in English.</p>

      <p>The term was coined in Swedish labor law to describe evening, night, and weekend shifts — working hours often assigned to invisible, low-control jobs in restaurants, logistics, cleaning, and private security.</p>
      
      <p>These sectors differ, but share one trait: they typically operate on thin margins, where labor costs are minimized and protections remain vague. We understand that.</p>
      
      <p>The idea for OB1 emerged in April 2025, after recovering three months of withheld unemployment benefits — a turning point made possible by navigating administrative fog through assertive, strategic communication.</p>
      
      <p>The underlying experience took place in winter 2024, while working as a dishwasher at <strong>Quan</strong>, 
          a high-end restaurant in Mälmo. Despite a high workload and overall good feedback, 
          no written contract was ever issued, and wages were paid late. The employer's classification of the departure 
          led to a suspension of benefits....</p>
      
      <p>OB1 is about knowing what you accept — and making sure others don’t go too far.
      It’s for workers who accept the reality of such jobs, but who want <strong>to set limits</strong>, to protect what little is owed to them — and <strong>to respond strategically when lines are crossed</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>It is not about seeking representation or relying on distant institutions but for connecting with those who have faced informal contracts, delayed wages, intimidation, or unclear employment status — and those who’ve found ways to document, challenge, or navigate such situations. </p>
      
      <p>We don’t rely on lawyers — most of us can’t afford them. We don’t turn to unions either — time is short, fatigue is real, and responses are often too slow. Instead, in 2025, we leverage permissionless tools, platforms, apps and tactics that don’t require approval to act. </p>
