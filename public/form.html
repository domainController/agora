    <summary>What is an OB1 circle?</summary>
    <p>
      An OB1 Circle is a Sweden-based peer group for people working off-hours who face legal irregularities or uncertain conditions. 
      There are three types of circles:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Forum Circles</strong> –  A hosted forum on OB1, structured by topic and coming soon.</li>
        <li><strong>Message Circles</strong> – Planned WhatsApp or Telegram groups for real-time peer exchange.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Circles</strong> – Facebook groups or similar are considered for broader, informal sharing.</li>
      </ul>
      OB1 circles may be mobile-first, desktop-based, or community-managed. They grow only if enough people show interest.
